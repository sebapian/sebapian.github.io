          <p class="blog-content">I strongly believe that there is no problem where there isn’t a solution to. Mixing this with communication and rationality, most problems can be approached stress free. However, I understand that humans often have feelings and emotions, which can come in between decision making. This is why I always approach someone who is not emotionally attached to a problem to provide me logical and unobstructive advice.</p>
          
          <p class="blog-content">Another core personal value of mine is to be positive and bring positivity to the people around me. I love life and the wonder it brings. The green nature and sun rays always has a place in my soul. I am lucky to be in New Zealand where pollution isn’t as rampant and I get to experience fresh air every single day. When I feel stressed or if life is not going the way I want it to, I always reset my feelings and thoughts with a hike or a swim in the beach. Experiencing nature is my favourite way to gain an endorphin boost! This also ties in with my value of healthy mind, healthy body, to enjoy everything great that this Earth has to offer.</p>
          
          <p class="blog-content"><b>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</b></p>
          <p class="blog-content">I cannot think of an ethical decision I had to make but I would use my pursue into programming and joining DevAcademy as an example. Sometimes making a career change can be quite daunting and it was hard for me to weigh having a stable and comfortable paying career or restarting to do something new. How I overcame my decision to proceed was through a series of question to myself and challenging/reviewing my values. One of the most important question I kept asking myself was, “Will I regret not doing this, 1 year later, 5 years later, 10 years later?” The answer was always yes. So then I weighed both options through their possible outcomes and how that aligned with my goals, future plans and interests. I also approached my family and friends for advice.</p>

          <p class="blog-content"><b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</b></p>
          <p class="blog-content">Growing up, my father was the provider for the family and he worked really hard to get our family financially stable. Unfortunately, he passed away when I was 8 years old. To be honest, I have little direct impressions of my father. All I can remember of him is someone who was hard-working, caring and soft, reliable, and determined.</p>
          <p class="blog-content">After my father passed on, my mum quickly filled the gap of being the head of the family. She was strong-willed, never dwelled in sorrows, outgoing and nature loving, strict but reasonable, and always had a smile with her friends. Raising 3 children, all who ended up with a Bachelor’s Degree is no easy feat I can tell you. Even taking care of me alone would have been difficult! The amount of love and care she has provided for us, is undying and I am ever grateful towards her.</p>
          <p class="blog-content">As I spent most of my childhood under her care, I would say that my traits has a direct correlation with her values. I can see a lot of similarities like outgoingness, not dwelling in sorrows and positive outlook on life. Also growing up dominantly with a mother figure, I understand why I am generally more feely towards people and empathetic. There were times where I wished I was able to spend more time with my father and maybe learn a few tricks to be someone as reliable as him, but I am lucky enough to be where I am and I count my blessings.</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">2. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>

          <p class="blog-content"><b>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</b></p>
          <p class="blog-content">One of my strengths when it comes to learning is that I am able to pick up the technical concepts easily. This is because I carry out trial and errors during the learning phase and see what similarities/differences are for the material elements.<br>The biggest limitation for me is the short duration of my focus when it comes to learning. Everything learning related usually takes time in order to gain depth on the topic. I tend to lose focus quickly when it comes to learning, especially when the learning style does not have any material that has hands-on application.</p>

          <p class="blog-content"><b>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</b></p>
          <p class="blog-content">My ability to look at things positively no matter how hard things can get would help me incredibly with my learning journey. I believe problems that we are not able to solve are just problems we have YET to solve. Through perseverance and commitment, solutions to any problems can be achieved. </p>
