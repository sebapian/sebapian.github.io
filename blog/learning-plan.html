          <h3 class="sub-title">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">My long term goal is to create something of my own that solves a problem whether it be an app or a service. I wish to utilise the skills and knowledge I gain to make this happen, through continuous learning and experience gained working with a renowned and mentoring employer (short-term).</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">One of my strengths when it comes to learning is that I am able to pick up the technical concepts easily. This is because I carry out trial and errors during the learning phase and see what similarities/differences are for the material elements.<br>The biggest limitation for me is the short duration of my focus when it comes to learning. Everything learning related usually takes time in order to gain depth on the topic. I tend to lose focus quickly when it comes to learning, especially when the learning style does not have any material that has hands-on application.<br>This makes me some sort of a <b>"Jack of all Trades, Master of None"</b></p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">Tying in with the previous number, it would be my ability to maintain focus (also discipline)over a longer period than I currently do. This will greatly improve my time management as well as provide an overall balanced but goal-driven life. Also, I would like to further improve my growth mindset with experiences and learning through interactions with the Facilitator and fellow Cohorts.</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This includes:</h3>
          <p class="blog-content"><b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</b></p>
          <p class="blog-content">I will go through the required tasks first and understand the overall requirements. This will then allow me to break down tasks into sub-tasks and set an allocated time during the day for each of them. Setting dead-lines for each sub-tasks will help me plan better. This will be aided with the recommended timebox. Getting help/insight from Facilitators and fellow cohorts regarding problem takling will definitely help find my direction to where I want to be time and discipline wise.</p>
          <p class="blog-content"><b>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</b></p>
          <p class="blog-content">First of all, I have to acknowledge the situation when I am unable to proceed any further with my own abilities. Breaking down problems into sub-problems will help me feel less overwhelming and help me organise better the steps needed to be undertaken. Googling a problem is key, a Developer friend once told me "The problem you have, would most likely have been solved by someone on the internet". If all fails, I will seek help from fellow cohorts and facilitator. </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">Working together with allocated times for tasks, if the problem starts exceeding the time required, I will immediately request help from others so that I am able to meet the required deadlines.</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">Easy to approach, encouragement, understanding, quick to respond, life/code hacks are always appreciated</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">I have just resigned from my full time job and my families and friends understand my commitment during the 4 months study period. Now I have to do my part in giving the course undivided attention and focus.</p>
