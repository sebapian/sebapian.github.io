          <h2 class="blog-title">Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
          <div class="blog-date">Updated: 24/07/2022</div>

          <p class="blog-content">
            I have just finished the foundation part of the Web Development course and will be heading to bootcamp in a week’s time. These are the questions I reflect upon that I would like to implement going into the Bootcamp!
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            My long term goal has not change and it is to create something of my own that solves a problem whether it be an app or a service. I wish to utilise the skills and knowledge I gain to make this happen, through continuous learning and experience gained working with a renowned and mentoring employer (short-term). For now my focus will be on Web Development, but I intend to explore what field of programming I am interested or passionate in once this course is over.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            My biggest strength is still my ability to pick up on technical concepts easily. However, throughout the foundations, I have understood how requesting for help further accelerates this ability. I intend to utilise this in bootcamp to my advantage so that I am able to provide value to my pair and fellow group-mates. Throughout the foundation, I have also realised that I tend to celebrate my efforts too early. For example, I would lose focus on the task in hand for the day once I decide to give myself a long break. This decreases my productivity and ruins my time management. I hope that with the coming foundations, the controlled environment and time frames would help strengthen my resolve and focus.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Tying in with my limitation above, keeping focus for nine weeks I think will be my biggest non-technical challenge. However, I believe that being in an environment where I have supportive cohorts and facilitators will help my situation. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">What non-technical skills – human skills – would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            I would like to develop my ability to work together with groups, especially when it comes to taking in feedback and being able to provide valuable feedback. Something that I would like to improve on in a team environment is decision making, based on logical assessment (time, risk-reward) and human-emotion understanding. Understanding the benefits of meditation and self-reflection, I would like to instil these habits into my daily routine. I want to be a better version of myself every day and I see these as incredibly helpful tools to understand what I did well and not. Being in a controlled environment for 2 months where there is intensity and deadlines, could make me gain the focus and time-management that I want to improve on.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Easy to approach, words of encouragement, empathetic criticisms, quick to respond and a mentoring mindset!
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            I hope that I am able to prove my passion and strengths towards Technology. I expect myself to gain new abilities not only on the technical side of things but core wise. I want to come out of the bootcamp being a better version of myself and having worked on my limitations, making them less of a limit on what I know I am able to achieve. In saying that, I am happy that I have taken my first step towards my passion and I cannot wait to see what lies ahead of me.

          <h2 class="blog-title">Foundation Learning Plan</h2>
            
          <h3 class="sub-title">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">My long term goal is to create something of my own that solves a problem whether it be an app or a service. I wish to utilise the skills and knowledge I gain to make this happen, through continuous learning and experience gained working with a renowned and mentoring employer (short-term).</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">One of my strengths when it comes to learning is that I am able to pick up the technical concepts easily. This is because I carry out trial and errors during the learning phase and see what similarities/differences are for the material elements.<br>The biggest limitation for me is the short duration of my focus when it comes to learning. Everything learning related usually takes time in order to gain depth on the topic. I tend to lose focus quickly when it comes to learning, especially when the learning style does not have any material that has hands-on application.<br>This makes me some sort of a <b>"Jack of all Trades, Master of None"</b></p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">Tying in with the previous number, it would be my ability to maintain focus (also discipline)over a longer period than I currently do. This will greatly improve my time management as well as provide an overall balanced but goal-driven life. Also, I would like to further improve my growth mindset with experiences and learning through interactions with the Facilitator and fellow Cohorts.</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This includes:</h3>
          <p class="blog-content"><b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</b></p>
          <p class="blog-content">I will go through the required tasks first and understand the overall requirements. This will then allow me to break down tasks into sub-tasks and set an allocated time during the day for each of them. Setting dead-lines for each sub-tasks will help me plan better. This will be aided with the recommended timebox. Getting help/insight from Facilitators and fellow cohorts regarding problem takling will definitely help find my direction to where I want to be time and discipline wise.</p>
          <p class="blog-content"><b>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</b></p>
          <p class="blog-content">First of all, I have to acknowledge the situation when I am unable to proceed any further with my own abilities. Breaking down problems into sub-problems will help me feel less overwhelming and help me organise better the steps needed to be undertaken. Googling a problem is key, a Developer friend once told me "The problem you have, would most likely have been solved by someone on the internet". If all fails, I will seek help from fellow cohorts and facilitator. </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">Working together with allocated times for tasks, if the problem starts exceeding the time required, I will immediately request help from others so that I am able to meet the required deadlines.</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">Easy to approach, encouragement, understanding, quick to respond, life/code hacks are always appreciated</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
          <p class="blog-content">I have just resigned from my full time job and my families and friends understand my commitment during the 4 months study period. Now I have to do my part in giving the course undivided attention and focus.</p>
