        <h3 class="sub-title">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">My long term goal is to create something of my own that solves a problem whether it be an app or a service. I wish to utilise the skills and knowledge I gain to make this happen, through continuous learning and experience gained working with a renowned and mentoring employer (short-term).</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">One of my strengths when it comes to learning is that I am able to pick up the technical concepts easily. This is because I carry out trial and errors during the learning phase and see what similarities/differences are for the material elements.<br>The biggest limitation for me is the short duration of my focus when it comes to learning. Everything learning related usually takes time in order to gain depth on the topic. I tend to lose focus quickly when it comes to learning, especially when the learning style does not have any material that has hands-on application.<br>This makes me some sort of a <b>"Jack of all Trades, Master of None"</b></p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">Tying in with the previous number, it would be my ability to maintain focus over a longer period than I currently do. This will greatly improve my time management as well as provide an overall balanced but goal-driven life. Also, I would like to further improve my growth mindset with experiences and learning through interactions with the Facilitator and fellow Cohorts.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This includes: </h3>
