          <h3 class="sub-title">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">Emotional intelligence is the ability to be aware, manage and regulate emotions in yourself and others. This includes understanding, acknowledging and managing your emotions in positive ways, empathy towards others, take charge of challenges and diffuse problems. It can be beneficial to connect with your feelings, turn intentions into actions, and make logical and sound decisions based of what matters most to you. These has direct impact on your physical health, mental health, social intelligence, relationships and performance at school or work.</p>

          <p class="blog-content">What I’ve learnt from my research is that emotional intelligence is not something you’re born with, but something you gain as you set your mind to it. Earlier in the previous sprints, it is taught that the brain has the ability to change and adapt as a result of experience, short for Neuroplasticity. There are 4 main attributes to build up EQ:</p>
          <ul class="blog-content">
            <li>Self-management</li>
            <li>Self-awareness</li>
            <li>Social awareness</li>
            <li>Relationship management</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 class="sub-title">How is it different to IQ?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">The easiest way to understand the comparison between IQ and EQ is that one focuses on book smart and the other is street smart, respectively. They fall under general intelligence, but both have different focuses. </p>

          <p class="blog-content">IQ centers on abilities such as:</p>
          <ul class="blog-content">
            <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
            <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
            <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
            <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
            <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="blog-content">EQ focuses on abilities such as:</p>
          <ul class="blog-content">
            <li>Identifying emotions</li>
            <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
            <li>Perceiving/evaluating how others feel</li>
            <li>Self regulation of emotions</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="sub-title">Why is it Important?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">EQ is important because it helps you to understand deeply source of emotions and how it corelates with actions. For example, when under a great deal of stress, an emotion whether it be sadness or anger may surface and lead to an unpleasant action. Having the ability to accept that emotion and managing it could turn a negative experience into a neutral or even positive one. However, it doesn’t mean that you should be locking in your emotion and hiding your feelings – it just means waiting for an appropriate time and venue to express them. This is tied to Self-Regulation which is expressing your emotions appropriately.</p>

          <p class="blog-content">There are many more abilities EQ focuses on that can directly affect your relationships with your co-workers, partners, friends, and families resulting in an overall happier and balanced life. EQ also ties in with important social skills that includes active listening, verbal communication skills, non-verbal communication skills, leadership and persuasiveness.</p>
