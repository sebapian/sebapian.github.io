          <h3 class="sub-title">How Understanding the Principles of Neuroplasticity Benefits People</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Neuroplasticity describes a brain’s ability to grow and adapt through experiences. Breaking the word down, <b><i>neuro</i></b> refers to neurons or nerve cells that are fundamental units of the brain and nervous system. It transforms and relay electrical signals when receiving sensory input from the external world and sending motor commands to our muscles. <b><i>Plasticity</i></b> on the other hand refers to something of elasticity and flexibility, defined as being easily influenced or trained. Combining these two terms, neurons are adaptable.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Neurons that utilised frequently develop stronger connections whereas those that are not rarely or never used eventually die. As there are limited capacities in our brains, the needed adaptability of the brain in a changing environment will prune away the weak neurons to make way for new connections.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-content">
            How does neuroplasticity benefit people? Adaptability is key for the brain and the changing structure of neurons enables:

          <ul class="blog-content">
            <li>The ability to learn new things</li>
            <li>Recovery from brain events like strokes or traumatic injuries</li>
            <li>Rewire functions in the brain and body(loss of sight as an example, sense of hearing may heighten)</li>
            <li>Wide range of enhanced cognitive abilities</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 class="sub-title">For my Personal Benefit</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Understanding the above, I would like to strengthen the neurons that carry significance to subjects that matter and are of value to me. Skills and knowledge that aligns with my passion, career, relationships could be developed with the benefit of neuroplasticity. As neuron pathways strengthen through frequent use, I am making a commitment to practise regularly and put effort into the skills and knowledge I would like to gain. Hoping that one day, I am able to achieve greater mastery in these personal skills and knowledge to fill my life and people around me with happiness and content.

          <h3 class="sub-title">Methods to Increase Neuroplasticity</h3>

          <ol class="blog-content">
            <li><b>Enriching your Environment</b></li>
            <p class="blog-content">
              Learning environments have shown to simulate positive changes to the brain. This may range from learning a new language, travelling, learning to play an instrument, and reading. Activities such as these enhances connectivity between brain regions and help form new neural networks.
            </p>

            <li><b>Meditation</b></li>
            <p class="blog-content">
              Recent studies have shown that several areas of the brain become larger after meditation, such as the hippocampus and the fight or flight system in the amygdala.
            </p>

            <li><b>Get proper amount of Sleep</b></li>
            <p class="blog-content">
              Sleep promotes the growth of dendrites in brain neurons, which are the end of neurons that help transmit information from one neuron to the next. Strengthening these connections may increase our brain plasticity.
            </p>

            <li><b>Regular Exercise</b></li>
            <p class="blog-content">
              There are plenty of benefits to how exercising can benefit our neuroplasticity: Prevent neuron loss in key areas of the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory; Improves functional connectivity in the basal ganglia, the part of the brain responsible for motor control and learning.
            </p>

          <h2 class="blog-title">Growth Mindset</h2>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Understanding neuroplasticity is crucial because it enables one to believe that our brain capabilities are not static, but only ever-growing. This opens one’s doorway to many possibilities, believing they can learn anything and that their intelligence can grow through effort and actons. That is what it means to have a Growth Mindset! The counter to this mindset is Fixed Mindset – believing that intelligence is fixed and something innate.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-content">
            A growth mindset recognises that setbacks are a necessary part of the learning process and are motivated by challenges. View of failures are temporary and changeable, crucial for learning, resilience and performance.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">Impacts on Myself Researching Growth Mindset</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Researching this has further increased my resolve of being a better version of myself every day. Understanding the ability of the brain to improve through repetition and challenge has made me value these more. I will commit to my passion and work harder towards goals that make me and the people around me happy. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">Integration of Growth Mindset into my Learning Journey</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            I plan to practice daily on activities that work towards my current goals (i.e. programming, learning Vietnamese, and staying fit). As the research suggested, neuro-paths are strengthened through repetition and will lead to mastery in the particular field. Also, I promise myself to not give up when adversities are upon myself, knowing that I will only come out stronger from the experiences. I will take up criticism and learn from it.
