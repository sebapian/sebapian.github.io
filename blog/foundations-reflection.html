          <h3 class="sub-title">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to core learning?</h3>
          
          <ul class="blog-content">
            <li>I realised that I am not too afraid to ask for help when I am stuck on a problem. It helps when facilitators keep emphasising on their readiness to help no matter what problems it may be.</li>
            <li>I used to think that having strength in something means that I would be naturally good at something. However, this is false and EFFORT is still very much required.</li>
            <li>Luxuriate in the power of YET, don’t be gripped in the tyranny of NOW!</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="sub-title">What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Values have impact on my goals as they are something that I believe in fundamentally, which I would naturally work towards my beliefs. Diving and understanding what my values are helps me paint a picture of myself better and what learning routes are best suited for me to achieve my goals.
          </p>


          <p class="blog-content">
            Empathising is incredibly important as it is helps one relate to another better (or putting yourself in another’s shoes). In programming, there is no one way to do something and being open-minded helps you see multiple point of views, which we can equip these new founded ways into our set of skills.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Self-awareness is very important as programmers deals with problems all the time (whether it be technical or core). When stuck on a problem or program bug, understanding your capabilities and being able to assess multiple options is key. Problems can also introduce emotions which would disrupt our ability to think logically.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            Understanding that our minds are neuroplastic would be something that surprised me the most. There are scientific researches that prove that our mind is ever-growing and if we set our mind towards learning something, neuro-pathways on the particular skills will strengthen. A lot of time, I feel that when I am learning towards something, I hit a ceiling and the learning output is not as visible. However, this has taught me to be more persistent towards my learning, knowing that my efforts are not in vain and that in the background, my neurons in my brain are working hard!
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            I would say writing out my research was the most challenging aspect. This is because it has been some time since I have done research writing, where usually a lot of the information I learnt has only been read. However, I believe that writing these learnings out is much better as the information being learnt are more embedded in the brain. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            The core learnings are life-long learnings applicable to everything we do in our lives. We live in a world full of different minded people and when it comes to programming, it is important to understand different methods to carry out a task and be able to rely on each other for the better. Having improve our core abilities such as Emotional Intelligence or Growth Mindset will only help us become better learners and programmers.  
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

          <p class="blog-content">
            No, I do not feel like studying core learning was a waste of time. First of all, it helped me understand my values and how I could utilise it to help better my learning plan towards being a programmer. Being able to understand my strengths and flaws meant that I could adjust/implement accordingly. There was a lot of new learnings from the core such as neuroplasticity and emotional intelligence which expanded my view on how I could implement new techniques or redirect my focus towards being a better learner.
